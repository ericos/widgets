# @dojo/widgets/popup

Dojo's `Popup` widget allows popup content to be shown relative to a trigger widget.
The popup can be positioned `above` or `below` the trigger. The popup will move the content appropriately if there is not room in the desired position.

A `body` tag is used to render the popup as well as an underlay to ensure that the page cannot be interacted with whilst the popup is visible. The popup is designed to be used with toggle buttons / selects / menus.
